  <h2>Using Ferret (Ruby native port od Lucene)</h2> 
  <br />
  <p>
  Ferret is a Ruby native port of Lucene search indexer/searcher that shuold be easy to use.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <h3>Installation</h3>
    With Ruby 1.8.7, installation shuold be very simple and it shuold be done with:
    <pre>
      > gem install ferret
    </pre>
    However, it's not going to work (at least yet) with Ruby 1.9.2 so basically the only workaround here is to import other similar gem (doing hopefully the same thing) by executing:
    <pre>
      > gem install sdsykes-ferret
    </pre>
    This should install ferret and make it ready for use.
  <p>

    <h3>Some typical usage with Anemone (web crawler Ruby engine)</h3>
    What follows is an example of the code which is used to crawl certain web pages and add keywords into index. Then Ferret's search method is used to perform a fast search on the
    indexed words. As a crawler, Anemone is used and in order to run, you should (besides Ferret ie. sdsykes-ferret) install anemone gem as well:
    <pre>
      > gem install anemone
    </pre>
    And here is the sample:
    <div class="exclamated">
      <pre>
        require 'anemone'
        require 'ferret'
        require 'open-uri'

        include Ferret

        index = Index::Index.new(:path => './chrisumbel.idx')

        # crawl this page
        Anemone.crawl("http://www.chrisumbel.com") do |anemone|
          # only process pages in the article directory
          anemone.on_pages_like(/article\/[^?]*$/) do |page|
            #store the page in the index of 'title' is not nil
            if (page.doc.at('title'))
              index << {
                :url => page.url,
                :title => page.doc.at('title').text,
                :content => page.doc.css('div.content_piece').text
              }
            end            
            puts "#{page.url} indexed."
          end
        end

        # search the index for articles with either ruby or python
        index.search_each('content: "ruby" or "python"') do |id, score|
          puts "SCORE: #{score}\tTITLE: #{index[id][:title]}"
        end        
      </pre>
    </div>
  </p>

    <h3>Acts_As_Ferret plugin - integration with model</h3>
    For Rails framework, it's a great idea to put Ferret support into model so that, when new record is added, it's added automatically into the index. This is possible by using 
    Acts_As_Ferret plugin (github wiki page can be found <a href="https://github.com/jkraemer/acts_as_ferret/wiki">here</a>). To install it:
    <pre>
      > gem install acts_as_ferret
    </pre>
    Also, projects home page can be found <a href="http://www.jkraemer.net/projects/acts_as_ferret">here</a>.
    Now, to use it in a model file, you should add acts_as_ferret method:
    <pre>
      class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base
        acts_as_ferret
      end
    </pre>
    By using this, all CRUD operations will be performed on both ActiveRecord (as usual) and a ferret index for further searching. Aaf will try to connect to an indexing server via
    DRb if one is configured in config/ferret_server.yml for the current environment.
    Or you can do something like this (to make it more specialized) and not to affect whole model:
    <pre>
      class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base
        acts_as_ferret :fields => [:title, :content]
      end
    </pre>
    Now, to use this index, you can add find methods to your controller logic:
    <pre>
      Foo.find_with_ferret(query) # Query is a string representing your query
    </pre>
    Or you can get it like:
    <pre>
      class ActiclesController < ApplicationController
        def search
          @article = Article.find_with_ferret(@params['search_string'])
        end
      end
    </pre>

    <h3>More usage of Ferret</h3>
    There is a nice sample article explaining how to jump start into Ferret and it can be found <a href="http://www.chrisumbel.com/article/ruby_fulltext_ferret">here</a>. Also, I 
    downloaded ebook called 'Ferret' by O'Reilly which is a good guide into all things Ferret related.
    As for a sample, here is how it's possible to quickly create an index file:
    <pre>
      require 'ferret'
      include Ferret
      
      # get of create an index on the filesystem
      index = Index::Index.new(:path => './test.idx')
      
      # store a document
      index << {
        :title => 'A Cool Article',
        :content => 'Penguins are cool.'
      }
      
      # store another document
      index << {
        :title => 'A Hot Article',
        :content => 'Volcanoes are hot'
      }
    </pre>
    To search the index (searching for the word 'hot' in the content field), you can do something like this:
    <pre>
      # search the index for the word hot in the content field 
      index.search_each('content: "hot"') do |id, score|
        puts "SCOREL #{score}\tTITLE: #{index[id][:title]}"
      end
    </pre>
    In case all fields should be matched-up:
    <pre>
      #search the index for the word 'hot' in all fields
      index.search_each('*: "hot"') do |id, score|
        puts "SCORE: #{score}\tTITLE: #{index[id][:title]}"
      end
    </pre>
    To use highlighting, you can use following example which wraps matching terms in strong tags:
    <pre>
      # search the index for the word hot
      index.search_each('content: "hot"') do |id, score|
        # put highlights into a copy of the content field
        # by way of <string> HTML tags
        highlights = index.highlight('content: "hot"',
          id,
          :field => :content,
          :pre_tag => "&lt;strong&gt;",
          :post_tag => "&lt;/strong&gt;")
        
        puts highlights
      end
    </pre>
  </p>
