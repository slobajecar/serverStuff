  <h2>Bugzilla 4.0.1 installation under Ubuntu 11.04</h2> 
  <br />
  
  <p>
    Bugzilla installation have several dependencies and these are listed as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>Perl 5.8.1 or above</li>
      <li>Install database engine (I'll go with MySQL, so it has to be version 4.1.2. or higher)</li>
      <li>Install a webserver</li>
      <li>Install Bugzilla</li>
      <li>Install Perl modules</li>
      <li>Install a Mail Transfer Agent (Sendmail 8.7 or above, or an MTA that is Sendmail-compatible with at least this version)</li> 
      <li>Cofigure all of the above</li>
    </ul>
    This tutorial is based on my experience installing Bugzilla by following tutorial from 
    <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/4.0/en/html/installation.html">Bugzilla's installation site</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <h3>Perl</h3>
    I tried to install latest version of Perl with:
    <pre>
      $ sudo apt-get install perl
    </pre>
    It installed 5.10.1 and claimed to be the latest, but according to http://www.perl.org, latest version was 5.14. I could download and install latest version, but I didn't
    want to and continued further with my current 5.10.1 version. To know which version you are running:
    <pre>
      $ perl -v
    </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3>Install database engine</h3>
    Buzilla supports MySQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle as DB servers but I'm going to use MySQL here. First, to check if I have MySQL installed:
    <pre>
      $ mysql -v
    </pre>
    But I got error 1045 stating that I don't have permission to run mysql instance, you I tried with:
    <pre>
      $ mysql -u root -p
    </pre>
    This states that my username is 'root' and asks for a password. So, that was ok and I also learned that I have version 5.1.54-1ubuntu4 installed on my machine. If you 
    don't have MySQL installed, go to <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL web site</a> and get version 4.1.2 or higher. In Ubuntu, this can also be installer under 
    Ubuntu Software Center.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3>Install a webserver</h3>
    I already installed Apache web server and the steps I took you can see <a href="../apache/index.html">here</a>. Also, any web server capable of running CGI scripts should
    do fine. Anyway, Apache web server is highly recommended.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3>Installing Bugzilla</h3>
    First step was to <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/download/#stable">download bugzilla tarball</a>. I chose version 4.0.1 which was the latest stable version at the time
    this manual was wrote. Here is a link to the <a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/webtools/bugzilla-4.0.1.tar.gz">Bugzilla tarball</a>
    <br />
    Now I copied this tarball into Apache's htdocs folder since it has to be into folder accessible by web users. One option is to be in web server's doc folder (that's what
    I did), second is to be in /usr/local with symbolic link to the web server's document directories or an alias in the web server's configuration.
    <pre>
      $ sudo cp ~/Downloads/bugzilla-4.0.1.tar.gz /usr/local/apache2/htdocs
    </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3>Perl modules</h3>
    Buzilla's installation process is based on a script called checksetup.pl which first checks for appropriate versions of used Perl modules. To check if you have all 
    required modules, let the script check for it, but first uncompress downloaded tarball like:
    <pre>
      $ cd /usr/local/apache2/htdocs
      $ sudo gzip -d bugzilla-4.0.1.tar.gz
      $ sudo tar xvf bugzilla-4.0.1.tar
      $ cd bugzilla-4.0.1
      $ ./checksetup.pl --check-modules
    </pre>
    Last command will write which modules and appropriate versions are installed and which are not and will offer a command list that needs to be executed in order to 
    install all needed modules. To try to install all of them (and that's what I did) with one command:
    <pre>
      $ /usr/bin/perl install-modules.pl --all
    </pre>
    During this installation, installer always complained about the missing YAML which is probably some Perl module which was not installed on my machine. Also, it takes some 
    time for the script to finish. After finishing the script, I still left with a lot of uninstalled modules, so I tried to install them one by one (YAML being first,
    although it's not critical).
    <pre>
      $ sudo /usr/bin/perl install-modules.pl YAML
      $ sudo /usr/bin/perl install-modules.pl DateTime
      $ sudo /usr/bin/perl install-modules.pl Template
      $ sudo /usr/bin/perl install-modules.pl Email::Send
      $ sudo /usr/bin/perl install-modules.pl Email::MIME
    </pre>
    Then I tried again to run script for installing all required modules, but this time used 'sudo' since it looks like that was wrong the first time:
    <pre>
      $ sudo /usr/bin/perl install-modules.pl --all
    </pre>
    
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3>Installing Mail Transfer Agent</h3>
    I installed Sendmail on my Ubuntu by using:
    <pre>
      $ sudo apt-get install sendmail
    </pre>
    It installed Sendmail v.8.14.4-2ubuntu1.
