  <h2>Installation is done on Ubuntu 11.04 version which runs as a virtual box</h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
    To start, first download the Apache 2.2.19 installation to your computer which can be found on
    <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi">Apache server project download page</a>. You might also check for
    instruction on checking integrity of downloaded files. I downloaded <a href="http://www.reverse.net/pub/apache//httpd/httpd-2.2.19.tar.gz">httpd-2.2.19.tar.gz</a> 
    file to my /Downloads directory and extracted it there.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next step was to follow installation instructions which can be found on <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/install.html">Apache compiling and installing page</a>
    where I followed the 'overview for impatient' section. Everything appeared to work fine after that, so here is a short summary of what I did. First, here are the
    alternative instructions how to download and extract the package (I already did that by extensive use of Ubuntu's UI). To download package:
    <pre>
      $ lynx http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi
    </pre>
    and to extract it:
    <pre>
      $ gzip -d httpd-2.2.19.tar.gz
      $ tar xvf httpd-2.2.19.tar
      $ cd httpd-2.2.19
    </pre>
    When it's done, next step is to go into the httpd-2.2.19 directory and then install the application from there. First step there is to configure it:
    <pre>
      $ ./configure --prefix=PREFIX
    </pre>
    <i>PREFIX</i> here is a filesystem path under the which server should be installed. If ommited, it defaults to /usr/local/apache2. I actually ommited it, so in the
    further text I will make a reference to /usr/local/apache2 wherever PREFIX should be used. However, for flexibility, I will continue to use PREFIX. Next step is
    compilation and it is done with:
    <pre>
      $ make
    </pre>
    After that comes installation:
    <pre>
      $ sudo make install
    </pre>
    Server can be configured with:
    <pre>
      $ sudo nano PREFIX/conf/httpd.conf
    </pre>
    And finally, to check if server is running correctly:
    <pre>
      $ PREFIX/bin/apachectl -k start
    </pre>
    If everything is fine, you should be able to get your test page on your <a href="http://localhost">localhost</a> and you should see a bold h1 text 'It works!'. 
    You can now change your homepage (index.html) which is located in PREFIX/htdocs folder under name index.html by:
    <pre>
      $ sudo nano /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/index.html
    </pre>
    When this file is changed, you should see the changes when you refresh your localhost page in a browser.
    To stop the server, you can do:
    <pre>
      $ PREFIX/bin/apachectl -k stop
    </pre>
