  <h2>RSpec guidelines</h2> 
  <br />
  <p>
    <h3><a name="install">Starting and installing RSpec</a></h3>
    To start a new rails project without Test::Unit framework (for example, if I'm about to use RSpec):
    <pre>
      > rails new sample_app -T
    </pre>
    In that case, Gemfile should be modified so that it includes rspec gem. Since it should be used in both development and test environments, this is an example of using it in the new
    Gemfile:
    <pre>
      ...
      group :development do
        gem 'rspec-rails', '2.6.1'
      end

      group :test do
        gem 'rspec', '2.6.0'
        gem 'webrat', '0.7.3'
      end
      ...
    </pre>
    Webrat here is a testing utility which used to be included automatically as a dependancy, but now needs to be included explicitly. To install these gems:
    <pre>
      > bundle install
    </pre>
    And finally, in order to use RSpec instead of the Test::Unit, files needed for RSpec needs to be installed. This is done by:
    <pre>
      > rails generate rspec:install
    </pre>
    To start a test on whole <i>spec</i> directory:
    <pre>
      > rspec spec/
    </pre>
    You can also start just one test file:
    <pre>
      > rspec spec/models/user_spec.rb
    </pre>
    or just one example which is inside of the file:
    <pre>
      > rspec spec/models/user_spec.rb -e "should have an encrypted password attribute"
    </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3><a name="controller">Modifying controller RSpec tests</a></h3>
    Controller tests can only 'get' urls for that particular controller. To get other urls, you should use integration tests. 
    In generated controller RSpec tests, <i>describe</i> can have any text that explains what example block (between <i>it</i> and <i>do</i>) does. With <i>get 'home'</i> the GET
    operation is performed and it's result is analyzed by <i>response</i> later in the test. 
    If you want to render the views (what you might need because of the analysis of page content), you should add <i>render_views</i> command in the rspec file:
    <pre>
      describe PagesController do
        <strong>render_views</strong>
        ...
    </pre>
    Possible response analysis can be:
    <ul>
      <li>response.should be_success - checks that response has status 200 (OK)</li>
      <li>response.should have_selector('title', :content => "Sample title") - this one checks if there is a <i>title</i> with a 'Sample title' text present in the response</li>
      <li>response.should have_selector("h1>img", :class => "gravatar") - requires that there is a image inside of the h1 header with defined class called gravatar</li>
      <li>user_mode.should_not be_valid - checks if user_mode object is valid</li>
      <li>@user.encrypted_password.should_not be_blank - checks if specified attribute is blank or not</li>
      <li>@user.has_password?(@attr[:password]).should be_true - checks if selected attribute should be true or false</li>
      <li>@user.should be_nil - checks if selected object is nil</li>
      <li>@user1.should == @user2 - checks if user1=user2</li>
      <li>assigns(:user).should == @user - input is symbol argument and returns the value of the corresponding instance variable in the controller action</li>
      <li>response.should redirect_to(user_path(assigns(:user))) - checks for redirection to users page</li>
      <li>lambda do...end.should change(User, :count).by(1) - tests if number of users has changed by 1</li>
      <li>lambda do..end.should_not change(User, :count) - tests that users count haven't changed</li>
    </ul>
    It's also possible to add block of code in the test file which will be executed before each test:
    <pre>
      before(:each) do
        #
        # Define some preconditions here
        #
      end
      ... further tests...
    </pre>
    If using Factory Girl, some checks can be made even easier than with fixtures:
    <pre>
      before(:each) do
        @user = Factory(:user)
      end
      
      it "should be successfull" do
        get :show, :id => @user
        response.should be_success
      end
      
      it "should find the right user" do
        get :show, :id => @user
        assigns(:user).should == @user
      end
    </pre>
    Here, <i>:id => @user</i> does the same thing as <i>:id => @user.id</i> and <i>get :show</i> is same as <i>get 'show'</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3><a name="integration">Integration tests</a></h3>
    To generate integration tests (for example, for layout_links):
    <pre>
      > rails generate integration_test layout_links
    </pre>
    This will generate spec/requests/layout_links_spec.rb file. Good starting point would be to create test that will check existing routes like:
    <pre>
      describe "Layout Links" do
        it "should habe a Home page at '/'" do
          get '/'
          response.should have_selector('title', :content => "Home")
        end
      end
    </pre>
    This way, routes are checked, but in order to check if all the links are pointing correctly to assigned pages, you should do something like:
    <pre>
      it "should have the right links on the layout" do
        visit root_path
        click_link "About"
        response.should have_selector('title', :content => "About")
        click_link "Home"
        response.should have_selector('title', :content => "Home")
        ...
      end
    </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3><a name="modeltesting">Testing models</a></h3>
    Example of testing user model in spec/models/user_spec.rb
    <div class="exclamation">
      <pre>
        before(:each) do
          @attr = { :name => "Example User", :email => "some@email.com" }
        end
        
        it "should create a new instance given valid attributes" do
          User.create!(@attr)
        end
        
        it "should require a name" do
          user = User.new(@attr.merge(:name => "Other name"))
          user.should_not be_valid
        end
      </pre>
    </div>
    <i>Merge</i> method here is used to change on a fly some of the attributes of the model.
    <br />
    To point out that something needs to be tested but is not implemented yet:
    <pre>
      it "should require testing a name"
    </pre>
  </p>
