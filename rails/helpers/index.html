    <h3><a name="helpers">List of usable Rails 3 helper methods</a></h3>
    Inserting a image located in public/images, with defined alt and class tags.
    <pre>
      <%= image_tag("logo.png", :alt => "Sample App", :class => "round") %>
    </pre>
    To add image link, good approach would be to define separately image tag and separately a link like:
    <pre>
      <% logo = image_tag("logo.png", :alt => "Sample App", :class => "round") %>
      <%= link_to logo, root_path %>
    </pre>
    Adding a link called 'Home' which includes classes signup_button and round. Also, it uses named route (home_path) since every page created with controller (like 'home') has 
    appropriate named route called &ltpage_name&gt_path. These named routes are created when appropriate routing routes are defined in config/routes.rb.
    <pre>
      <%= link_to "Home", home_path, :class => "signup_button round" %>
    </pre>
    Link can be added and by passing reference to the object, helper is smart enough to get what needs to be treated as input
    <pre>
      <%= link_to user_path(@user), @user %>
      is equivalent to:
      <%= link_to user_path(@user), user_path(@user) %>
    </pre>
    Named routes which are created when adding route in config/routes.rb like:
    <pre>
      match '/about', :to => 'pages#about'
    </pre>
    are, for example:
    <pre>
      about_path => '/about'
      about_url => 'http://localhost:3000/about'
      or
      root_path => '/'
      root_path => 'http://localhost:3000'
    </pre>
    Looks for a file called app/views/layouts/_stylesheets.html.erb, evaluate it's contents and inserts results into the view. Can be used in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
    <pre>
      <%= render 'layouts/stylesheets' %>
    </pre>
    This can be also done for header and footer which will look up for corresponding _header.html.erb and _footer.html.erb files:
    <pre>
      <%= render 'layouts/header' %>
      <%= render 'layouts/footer' %>
    </pre>
    To include gravatar image:
    <%= gravatar_image_tag 'some@email.com' %>
    To redirect (if some condition is met, for example) to some other page:
    <pre>
    	redirect_to @user
    </pre>
    To add a form for posting data and related to a some object (here, for example, user), following peace of code can be used. Here, <i>f</i> represents a
    form itself.
    <pre>
    <%= form_for(@user) do |f| %>
    	<div class="someClass">
    		<%= f.label :name %><br/>
    		<%= f.text_field :name %>
    		<%= f.password_field :password %>
    		<%= f.submit "Sign up" %>
    </pre>
    <a name="errors">To add centralized errors to pages, you might add partials like this to the page where you create new users:</a>
    <pre>
    	<%= form_for(@user) do |f| %>
    		<%= render 'shared/error_messages' %>
    </pre>
    To handle this all the way, you should also create app/views/shared/_error_messages.html.erb file:
    <pre>
		<%= if @user.errors.any? %>
			<div id="error_explanation">
				<h2><%= pluralize(@user.errors.count, "error") %>
					prohibited this user from being saved:</h2>
				<p>There were problems with the following fields:</p>
				<ul>
					<% @user.errors.full_messages.each do |msg| %>
						<li><%= msg %></li>
					<% end %>
				</ul>
			</div>
		<% end %>    	
    </pre>
    Method <i>pluralize</i> writes number and following message in correct plural or singular mode.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3><a name="tools">Usable framework methods and tools</a></h3>
    To perform one-way hashing:
    <pre>
      require 'digest'
      def secure_hash(string)
        Digest::SHA2.hexdigest(string)
      end
    </pre>
    To make it more secure, you could add 'salt' as a timestamp:
    <pre>
      password = "secret"
      salt = secure_hash("#{Time.now.utc}--#{password}")
      encrypted_password = secure_hash("#{salt}--#{password}")
    </pre>
    Above, arguments to hashing functions are often separated with '--'.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3><a name="factorygirl">Factory Girl</a><h3>
    Since Factory Girl is mostly used in testing environment, it can be added in test group in Gemfile and then you shuold perform <i>bundle install</i>:
    <pre>
      group :test do
        ...
        gem 'factory_girl_rails', '1.0.1'
      end
    </pre>
    Many find that using factories is much more flexible that fixtures. To create factories, for example, you could start by adding spec/factories.rb file and define a User factory. By
    putting the factories.rb into spec/ directory we arrange for RSpec to load our factoried automatically whenever our tests run.
    <pre>
      # By using the symbol ':user', we get Factory Girl to simulate User model
      Factory.define :user do |user|
        user.name         "Some name"
        user.email        "some@email.com"
        user.password     "foobar"
        user.password_confirmation "foobar"
      end
    </pre>
    Now, with this setting, we can create new instance of the user with:
    <pre>
      @user = Factory(:user)
    </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3><a name="gravatar">Gravatar</a></h3>
    Gravatar gem can be installed through Gemfile and then executing <i>bundle install</i>. It uses Gravatar service which keeps avatars related to user's email address.
    <pre>
      ...
      gem 'gravatar_image_tag', '1.0.0'
      ...
    </pre>
    Now, to include image tag from Gravatar you can try:
    <pre>
      <%= gravatar_image_tag @user.email %>
    </pre>
    Since gravatar might be used on many places on site, a good option would be to create a helper method for getting it so that it can be used like:
    <pre>
      <%= gravatar_for @user, :size => 30 %>
    </pre>
    and <i>gravatar_for</i> helper might be defined as:
    <pre>
      def gravatar_for(user, options = { :size => 50 })
        gravatar_image_tag(user.email.downcase, :alt => user.name,
                                                :class => 'gravatar',
                                                :gravatar => options)
      end
    </pre>
    According to the Gravatar documentation, options to gravatar image are passed through :gravatar key where hash is passed as input option. Also, default option for size is already
    set in this example.
