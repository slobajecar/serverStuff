  <h2>Controller guidelines</h2> 
  <br />
  <p>
    <h3><a name="staticpages">Add static pages</a></h3>
    All pages located in <i>public</i> folder can be accessible from the browser, without the need to add routes.
    To add static pages by using controller (generates Pages controller with actions home and contact):
    <pre>
      > rails generate controller Pages home contact
    </pre>
    This will update config/routes.rb file to add statements for getting these pages.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3><a name="manualpages">Adding pages manually</a></h3>
    To add a page manually, you should first add it's action in the current controller class, for example:
    <pre>
      class PagesController < ApplicationController
        ...
        def about 
        end
    </pre>
    Then <i>about</i> action should be added into routes file (for example):
    <pre>
      SampleApp::Aplication.routes.draw do
        ...
        get "pages/about"
        ...
      end
    </pre>
    And finally, view should be added as well (in this case, you should create file about.html.erb with corresponding markup).
