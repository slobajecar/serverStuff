  <h2>DB operations from RoR point of view</h2> 
  <br />
  <p>
  Base class for working with databases in RoR world is <i>ActiveRecord</i>. Contrary to some other approaches, it's not working with DB over XML configuration files used for mapping,
  but it works by assigning attributes to each DB column. Other features of ActiveRecord are:
  <ul>
    <li>associations - possibility to define relationships between ActiveRecord classes like 1:1, 1:n and n:n.</li>
    <li>callbacks - set of hooks used to allow performing some actions during life cycle of the object 
        (ex. do something before saving, after record is updated create record in audit log</li>
    <li>validations - special set of callbacks allowing data validation on the model</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <h3><a name="install">Installation</a></h3>
    The connection to the DB that needs to be used is defined in config/database.yml file.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <h3><a name="model">Creating a model</a></h3>
    To create a model:
    <pre>
      > rails generate model User name:string email:string
    </pre>
    This will generate model, as well as DB migration file which can be found in db/migrate/&lt;timestamp&gt;_create_users.rb. There, <i>def self_up</i> describes what will happen when
    migration is executed and <i>def self_down</i> will describe what will happen migration is rolled back. Also, <i>t.timestamp</i> in this file is a special command that creates two
    'magic' columns called created_at and updated_at which are timestamps that automatically record when a given user is created and updated. Also, id column is automatcally created and
    autoincremented.
    To start migration:
    <pre>
      > rake db:migrate
    </pre>
    To roll back the migration:
    <pre>
      > rake db:rollback
    </pre>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <h3><a name="activerecord">ActiveRecord</a></h3>
    Nice place to play with ActiveRecord is the console sandbox accessible by:
    <pre>
      > rails console --sandbox
    </pre>
    Here are some snippets that should work on a model and which will create, read, update and delete (CRUD) some objects:
    <pre>
      User.new          
      => creates new user object in memory
      
      user = User.new(:name => "Some name", :email => "Some email")
      => creates new user object with some predefined values in memory
      
      user.save
      => saves in-memory user object to the DB
      
      User.create(:name => "Some name", :email => "Some email")
      => creates new object in memory and saves it directly to DB
      
      user.destroy
      => deletes a record from the DB
      
      User.find(1)
      => returns user object with id=1. If not found, ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound exception is raised
      
      User.find_by_email("some@email.com")
      => finds a user by email. It can be anything else than email, depending on the fields in the DB.
      
      User.first
      => returns first user
      
      User.all
      => returns all users from the DB
      
      > user.email = "some@email.com"
      > user.save
      => changes email address of the current user and saves this change (update)
      
      user.reload.email
      => reloads email field of the current object from the DB and disregards all changes to the email property of the user object previously done
      
      user.update_attributes(:name => "Some name", :email => "Some email")
      => updates selected fields with new values, but these fields should have attr_accessible attribute
    </pre>
  </p>

    <h3>Rake manipulations</h3>
    To perform migration on a DB:
    <pre>
      > rake db:migrate
    </pre>
    To rollback last migration
    <pre>
      > rake db:rollback
    </pre>
    To reset DB completely
    <pre>
      > rake db:reset
    </pre>
    To migrate data from dev DB to test DB
    <pre>
      > rake db:test:prepare
    </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3>How to add index on DB column</h3>  
    First you should create appropriate migration:
    <pre>
      > rails generate migration add_email_uniqueness_index
    </pre>
    Then, add index in the created migration file (here it would be db/migrate/&lt;timestamp&gt;_add_email_uniqueness_index.rb:
    <pre>
      class AddEmailUniquenessIndex < ActiveRecord::Migration
        def self.up
          add_index :users, :email, :unique => true
        end
        
        def self.down
          remove_index :users, :email
        end
    </pre>
  </p>
  Finally, migrate the changes:
  <pre>
    > rake db:migrate
  </pre>
