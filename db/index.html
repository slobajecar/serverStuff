  <h2>DB operations from RoR point of view</h2> 
  <br />
  <p>
  Base class for working with databases in RoR world is <i>ActiveRecord</i>. Contrary to some other approaches, it's not working with DB over XML configuration files used for mapping,
  but it works by assigning attributes to each DB column. Other features of ActiveRecord are:
  <ul>
    <li>associations - possibility to define relationships between ActiveRecord classes like 1:1, 1:n and n:n.</li>
    <li>callbacks - set of hooks used to allow performing some actions during life cycle of the object 
        (ex. do something before saving, after record is updated create record in audit log</li>
    <li>validations - special set of callbacks allowing data validation on the model</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
