  <h2>RVM installation and usage</h2> 
  <br />
  
  <p>
    A lot of information can be obtained from <a href="https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/">RVM web site</a>, but I'll show some short version of my own tutorial, also based on 
    Rob Conery's screencast published on tekpub.com. Basically, this is an essence of what I will probably need in the future.

    <h3>Installing RVM for Ubuntu workstation</h3>
      1. Install Aptitude
      <pre>
        > sudo apt-get install aptitude
      </pre>
      2. Install base stuff (one by one):
      <pre>
      sudo aptitude install build-essential bison openssl libreadline5 \ 
                              libreadline5-dev curl git zlib1g zlib1g-dev \ 
                              libssl-dev libsqlite3-0 libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 \ 
                              libxml2-dev libmysqlclient-dev autoconf
      </pre>
      3. Use CURL to get and install the source for RVM
      <pre>
        > bash < <( curl http://rbm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-install-head )
      </pre>

      4. The post-install process for installing RVM is to apply this setting to a settings file with:
      <pre>
        > gedit .bashrc
      </pre>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And add last line to be:
      <pre>
        [[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" # This loads RVM into a shell session.
      </pre>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restart the console. If everything went fine, there should be response from the program if RVM is requested with:
      <pre>
        > rvm    
      </pre>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More on installing RVM can be found in <a href="https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/">RVM installation guide</a>.
